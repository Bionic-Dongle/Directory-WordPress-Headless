# Current Project Status

## 🎯 Where We Are
**Phase 1: Frontend Debugging** - Getting the beautiful directory interface to actually show up

## ⚠️ Current Issue
Website loads but shows a simple test component instead of the full Melbourne Directory interface.

## 🔧 What's Working
- ✅ Vite dev server runs without errors
- ✅ React app loads successfully  
- ✅ All dependencies installed correctly
- ✅ Icon import issues fixed
- ✅ Basic routing works

## 🐛 What's Broken
- ❌ Full directory interface not displaying
- ❌ Business cards not showing
- ❌ Hero section missing
- ❌ Category grid not visible

## 🎮 Next Actions for Devin
1. **Switch from test component back to full App**
2. **Debug why main directory interface isn't rendering**
3. **Ensure all components load properly:**
   - Navigation bar
   - Hero section (Melbourne Directory)
   - Category grid (Restaurants, Cafes, etc.)
   - Business cards (Joe's Coffee, Main Street Pizza, etc.)
   - Search and filters
   - Footer

## 🧪 How to Test Success
```bash
npm run dev
# Should show beautiful directory at localhost:5173
```

**Expected Result:** Professional business directory with:
- Melbourne Directory hero with search
- 6 category buttons (Restaurants, Cafes, Retail, Services, Healthcare, Beauty)
- 4 featured business cards with photos and ratings
- Working search and filter functionality
- Professional Tailwind styling

## 📁 Key Files to Check
- `src/App.tsx` - Main app component (currently showing test)
- `src/components/` - All UI components copied from V0
- `src/lib/wordpress-api.ts` - API layer with mock data
- `src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces

## 🚫 Do NOT Touch
- WordPress setup (Phase 2)
- Deployment configuration
- Project structure changes
- Adding new features

**Focus:** Get the existing copied components working perfectly first.
